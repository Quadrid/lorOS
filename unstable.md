## Changes for unstable
- Commands which should make conflicting partitions (size, letters) unconflicting: run.bat /// untested
- grub Distributor is lorOS: vde /// works
- userlink should now replace whitespaces in usernames: vde /// untested
- usblogin, bluetoothlogin and ldmauth added, but lacks a gui, we'll add this to our cutefish-settings fork i guess: vde, vdc /// should be fixed now
